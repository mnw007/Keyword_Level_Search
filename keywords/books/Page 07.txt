As Neil Gaiman said, “A book is a dream that you hold in your hand”. Imagine, if you could escape into your dreams, visit mythical places and travel back and forth in time. Experience the thrill of letting your imagination go wild. Books have that kind of power. They teleport you to places you might not otherwise get to see in your lifetime.


Many people take up book reading in different ways. Come to think of it, you can classify book readers into a few categories: the hopelessly devoted reader, the all-the-timer/compulsive/voracious/anything-goes reader and the occasional reader. The first two groups are those who cannot live without books. Wherever they go, whatever they do, they need a book with them. They even read between work, or while they eat, just because they can't put the book down. You get the picture, right? And then, there is the last group of readers, who only pick up books when they have free time to spare. They are not as addicted to reading as the first two categories of readers. 


Enough about readers, let us take a look at what they like to read


Comics: Whoever thinks that comics are only for kids, has never been more wrong. From Superman and Spiderman to Wonder Woman and Black Widow, comics bring to you a world of superheroes that can inspire you to become a better human being. You can add Marvel: Superhero Legends, The Avengers - Battle Against Loki and Marvel Adventures Spider-Man to this category. Also, let us not forget the wise world of Calvin and Hobbes comics or the adventurous tales in Tintin comics.


Short Stories: If you do not have the patience to sit through long novels, and want your tales to be short and sweet, then short stories are for you. Books, such as The New Collected Short Stories by Jeffrey Archer, Interpreter of Maladies: Stories of Bengal, Boston and Beyond by Jhumpa Lahiri, Love Among the Bookshelves by Ruskin Bond and Trigger Warning: Short Fictions and Disturbances by Neil Gaiman, fall into the category of short stories.


Novels: Whether you are a diehard fan of the Harry Potter series, or you love to delve into the thrilling world of The Millennium Trilogy, novels keep you on the edge of your seat with action-packed tales of adventures. They are often long, and are best for readers who devour books like popcorn. Since we are talking about novels, let us not forget the novellas. These books are shorter than novels but the tales are longer than short stories.


Nonfiction Books: From how-to and technical books to text and reference books, you can find a host of nonfiction titles online. Apart from them, you can also find spiritual, motivational and religious books online. If you are taking a competitive exam, you can seek guidance from entrance exam preparatory books.


Biographies and Autobiographies: These books tread a fine line between fiction and nonfiction. They are usually filled with factual events from a person’s life, but can also feature hearsay on certain occasions. Books like Wings of Fire: An Autobiography by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, My Story by Kamala Das, My Experiments With Truth by Mahatma Gandhi are some of the well-known autobiographies. Captain Cool: The M. S. Dhoni Story by Gulu Ezekiel and Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson are a few popular biographies that you can consider reading.
