Your laptop is your biggest gateway to the online world and beyond (except for your smartphone, of course). And we all have different priorities:

Performance laptops for creators, professionals, or gamers – we’ve got powerhouses that rival what desktops deliver.
Ultraportable laptops for folks who are always on the go.
Budget laptops that give you value and performance in a single package.
Innovative 2-in-1s – part laptop, part tablet, part nothing you’ve seen before – for those who want to tap the untested power of the new.
Business Laptops

Our ThinkPad laptops set the standard for business computing. Tough as nails and reliable, these laptops and 2-in-1s keep you productive in any environment. And it gives you the tools you need – from high-end processing and graphics to cutting-edge touchscreen technology, from pen support to epic battery life, ThinkPad keeps you productive and engaged wherever you are.

Gaming Laptops

Gamers don’t have to feel bound to their desktops anymore. Legion by Lenovo lets you dominate your competitors wherever you are. Are you hardcore? We’ve got you covered with laptops that boast powerful discrete graphics and overclockable CPUs. We’ve also got budget options for casual gamers. But whatever laptop you choose will let you lose yourself in immersive audio and vivid displays.

Convertible Laptops

Ready for something different? Our groundbreaking Yoga laptops, tablets and 2-in-1s will definitely turn heads – and you’ll find new ways to do what you love. Vibrant displays and immersive audio? Check. Tablets that work as movie or presentation projectors . Yep. Pen support for artists and designers and a Halo Keyboard that’s seriously like nothing you’ve ever seen before? It’s all yours to explore.
