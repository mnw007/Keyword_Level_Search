The Definitive Guide

Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum.

It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time.

This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started in Python, why you should learn it and how you can learn it. However, if you knowledge of other programming languages and want to quickly get started with Python, visit Python tutorial page.

What is Python (Programming)? - The Basics

https://www.programiz.com/

Before getting started, lets get familiarized with the language first.

Python is a general-purpose language. It has wide range of applications from Web development (like: Django and Bottle), scientific and mathematical computing (Orange, SymPy, NumPy) to desktop graphical user Interfaces (Pygame, Panda3D).

The syntax of the language is clean and length of the code is relatively short. It's fun to work in Python because it allows you to think about the problem rather than focusing on the syntax.

    Simple Elegant Syntax

    Programming in Python is fun. It's easier to understand and write Python code. Why? The syntax feels natural. Take this source code for an example:

    a = 2
    b = 3
    sum = a + b
    print(sum)


    Even if you have never programmed before, you can easily guess that this program adds two numbers and prints it.
    Not overly strict

    You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python. Also, it's not necessary to add semicolon at the end of the statement.

    Python enforces you to follow good practices (like proper indentation). These small things can make learning much easier for beginners.
    Expressiveness of the language

    Python allows you to write programs having greater functionality with fewer lines of code. Here's a link to the source code of Tic-tac-toe game with a graphical interface and a smart computer opponent in less than 500 lines of code. This is just an example. You will be amazed how much you can do with Python once you learn the basics.
    Great Community and Support

    Python has a large supporting community. There are numerous active forums online which can be handy if you are stuck. Some of them are:
        Learn Python subreddit
        Google Forum for Python
        Python Questions - Stack Overflow

Run Python on Your Operating System

https://www.programiz.com/

You will find the easiest way to run Python on your computer (Windows, Mac OS X or Linux) in this section.
Install and Run Python in Mac OS X
Install and Run Python in Linux (Ubuntu)
Install and Run Python in Windows

    Go to Download Python page on the official site and click Download Python 3.6.0 (You may see different version name).
    When the download is completed, double-click the file and follow the instructions to install it.
    When Python is installed, a program called IDLE is also installed along with it. It provides graphical user interface to work with Python.
    Open IDLE, copy the following code below and press enter.

    print("Hello, World!")

    To create a file in IDLE, go to File > New Window (Shortcut: Ctrl+N).
    Write Python code (you can copy the code below for now) and save (Shortcut: Ctrl+S) with .py file extension like: hello.py or your-first-program.py

    print("Hello, World!")

    Go to Run > Run module (Shortcut: F5) and you can see the output. Congratulations, you've successfully run your first Python program.

 
Your First Python Program

https://www.programiz.com/

Often, a program called "Hello, World!" is used to introduce a new programming language to beginners. A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs "Hello, World!".

However, Python is one of the easiest language to learn, and creating "Hello, World!" program is as simple as writing print("Hello, World!"). So, we are going to write a different program.
Program to Add Two Numbers

How this program works?

Line 1: # Add two numbers

Any line starting with # in Python programming is a comment.

Comments are used in programming to describe the purpose of the code. This helps you as well as other programmers to understand the intent of the code. Comments are completely ignored by compilers and interpreters.

Line 2: num1 = 3

Here, num1 is a variable. You can store a value in a variable. Here, 3 is stored in this variable.

Line 3: num2 = 5

Similarly, 5 is stored in num2 variable.

Line 4: sum = num1+num2

The variables num1 and num2 are added using + operator. The result of addition is then stored in another variable sum.

Line 5: print(sum)

The print() function prints the output to the screen. In our case, it prints 8 on the screen.
Few Important Things to Remember

To represent a statement in Python, newline (enter) is used. The use of semicolon at the end of the statement is optional (unlike languages like C/C++, PHP). In fact, it's recommended to omit semicolon at the end of the statement in Python.

Instead of curly braces { }, indentations are used to represent a block.

   im_a_parent:
    im_a_child:
        im_a_grand_child
    im_another_child:
        im_another_grand_child
