Storyline
For Emma Swan, life has been anything but a happy ending. But when she's reunited with Henry - the son she gave up for adoption ten years ago - on the night of her 28th birthday, everything changes. The now 10-year-old Henry is in desperate need of Emma's help because he believes from reading a book of fairy-tales that she's the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming - who sent her away from the Enchanted Forest to be protected from a curse that was enacted by the Evil Queen. Emma initially refuses to believe a word of Henry's story but soon finds that his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine is more than it seems. Because it's in Storybrooke that all of the classic characters we know are frozen in time with no memories of their former selves - except for the Evil Queen, who is Storybrooke's mayor and Henry's adoptive mother Regina Mills. Now, as the epic "Final Battle" for the future of both worlds approaches, Emma will have to accept her destiny and uncover the mystery behind a place ... Written by ahmetkozan

Trivia
There are many references to the television show Lost (2004). Among them are many of the same actors and actresses, the Apollo candy bars, and the television show "Exposé". However, if you look closely in the first season, you will also see an Oceanic Airliner flying overhead, and the time that Storybrooke gets frozen, is 8:15. The same as Oceanic Flight 815. The address for Regina's house is 108, which is the amount of minutes on the clock in the hatch. Henry Mills' apartment in season 7 is 815. See more »
Goofs
Throughout season 4, Regina is seen to be wearing a wedding ring. While Regina is not married, Lana Parrilla was wed to her husband just before filming for season 4 began and probably forgot to take her ring off when shooting. See more »

Season 7, what a tragedy.
10 January 2018 | by lin_mehmed – See all my reviews
It's so sad to say this but I used to really like this show, up until season 6, when things should have ended. Why did they decide to do a season 7 with the same story line as before, my brain will never understand. I despise season 7. I can't stand "Cinderella"s character or the actress. The character just seems so weak, without any motivation or attitude to live life or to act, which isn't how I pictured Cinderella. I thought she would be more rebellious and have more of a spirit. Don't even get me started on the actress - she has no acting skills, I feel like every line is improvised and the directors just went with the first shot they took. At least try to pronounce words correctly.

So please next season - improve acting, improve story line, be a bit more original, and get some good actors, seriously !
