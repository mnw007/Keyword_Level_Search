“
"It's titled Once Upon a Time and it's the story of us. [...] I wish the world could know the story of my family, how it was all true, how every moment of it happened. And you may think this is just a story. But that's the thing about stories. They're more than words. They live inside of us. They make us who we are. And, as long as someone believes that, there will always be magic."

Synopsis
From the inventive minds of Lost executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis comes a bold new imagining of the world, where fairy tales and the modern-day are about to collide.

And they all lived happily ever after - or so everyone was led to believe. Emma Swan knows how to take care of herself. She's a 28-year-old bail bonds collector who's been on her own ever since she was abandoned as a baby. But when the son she gave up years ago finds her, everything starts to change. Henry is now 10 years old and in desperate need of Emma's help. He believes that Emma actually comes from an alternate world and is Snow White and Prince Charming's missing daughter. According to his book of fairytales, they sent her away to protect her from the Evil Queen's curse, which trapped the fairytale world forever, frozen in time, and brought them into our modern world.

Of course Emma doesn't believe a word, but when she brings Henry back to Storybrooke, she finds herself drawn to this unusual boy and his strange New England town. Concerned for Henry, she decides to stay for a while, but she soon suspects that Storybrooke is more than it seems. It's a place where magic has been forgotten, but is still powerfully close... where fairytale characters are alive, even though they don't remember who they once were. The epic battle for the future of all worlds is beginning, but for good to win, Emma will have to accept her destiny and fight like hell.[2]

Development
Once Upon a Time has been conceived by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis in 2004 before joining the writing staff of Lost, but they wanted to wait until that series was over to focus on their project. Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof helped in the development of the series as a consultant. Eventually, they sold the pilot to ABC on October 28, 2010.[5] On February 1, 2011, the network gave a pilot order to the series.[6] On March 4, 2011, it was announced that Damon Lindelof was no longer involved in the project.[7]

On May 13, 2011, the series is picked up by ABC,[8] and it premiered on October 23, 2011.[9] On November 3, 2011, Once Upon a Time received a first full season order,[10] and concluded its Season One on May 13, 2012.[11]

Three days before, the series was renewed for a second season,[12] which premiered on September 30, 2012.[13] On May 10, 2013, Once Upon a Time was renewed for Season Three,[14] as the second season ended on May 12, 2013.[15] The third season premiered on September 29, 2013.[16]

As the series concluded its third season on May 11, 2014,[17] ABC renewed it three days before on May 8, 2014 for the fourth season.[18] It premiered on September 28, 2014,.[19] On May 7, 2015, the series was renewed for Season Five,[20] as Season Four ended on May 10, 2015.[20]

The fifth season premiered on September 27, 2015.[21] On March 3, 2016, the series got an early renewal for its sixth season.[22] Once Upon a Time's one hundredth episode is titled "Souls of the Departed", and aired on March 6, 2016.[23] Season Five ended on May 15, 2016.[24]

The sixth season premiered on September 25, 2016.[25] On May 7, 2017, the series aired its highly anticipated musical episode, entitled "The Song in Your Heart".[26] Four days later, Once Upon a Time was renewed for its seventh season.[27] Season Six ended on May 14, 2017.[28]

The seventh season premiered on October 6, 2017.[29] On February 6, 2018, it was announced that the series would be ending after its seventh season.[1] Season Seven and the series concluded on May 18, 2018, with "Leaving Storybrooke".[30]

 Lady Rapunzel
Should we add that Lana is the actress to portray the biggest amount of characters in the show? (Evil Queen, Regina Mills, Roni, Evil Queen (Wish Realm) and Evil Queen (Serum)?

 Lady Junky
Evil Queen = Regina Mills = Roni = 1

So, she "only" portrayed 3 different actors so far.

In any case, if we add this info, it is in the trivia section of Lana's page.

What about characters, who are shapeshifted as other characters?
