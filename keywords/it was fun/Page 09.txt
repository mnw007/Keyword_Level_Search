it was fun while it lasted
it was fun while it lasted
Something was an enjoyable or worthwhile experience even though it was impermanent. Often indicates that the speaker is resigned to the fact that it cannot last. Look, it was fun while it lasted, but this summer romance had to end sometime. I didn't imagine spending the rest of my life in that career, but it was fun while it lasted.
