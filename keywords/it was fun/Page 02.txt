Please, I need someone to explain me why it is not correct to say "It was so fun" instead of "it was such fun"
Doesn´t fun in this case act as an adjetive?
Thank you

No, 'fun' can only be used as an abstract noun, so you are right that you have to say 'such fun'. There is no adjectival form of fun - you have to some word like 'amusing' or 'jolly', neither of which is close to the idea of fun. Perhaps that is why, colloquially, people do say "We had a fun time", but grammatically that is wrong - not that anyone cares about that these days!

Isn't 'it was such fun' a set phrase meaning 'we all had a wonderful time' or 'it was enjoyable'? 
We don't, after all, say "I almost had my leg bitten off. It was such danger!"
ADDED: Please provide us with a specimen sentence, Pepa 's.

For many people, 'fun' is an adjective now, so they can say 'it was very fun' and 'it was so fun'. I can't say these; for me it's still a noun, so I have to say 'a lot of fun' and 'such fun'. This is a rare instance of a noun converting to an adjective. The common use of it in 'a fun time' is indeterminate - you can't tell there whether it's a noun or adjective.

But we have dangerous to use there: It was so dangerous. But not it was so FUN.

Ah ... I think I see now. We can say 'it was such fun' because 'fun' is uncountable, whereas we would have to say 'it was such a danger'.

[With 'shit' we can do both, I'd say. 'It was so shit' and 'it was such shit' seem equally acceptable from a grammatical standpoint.]

I disagree, Beryl. Grammatically I think one has to say "It was so shitty". For me your usage of 'shit' equates to the use of 'fun' as a noun - usual, but ungrammatical.

Odd isn't it? I'm with etb (and you, I presume) in that I couldn't universally countenance using 'fun' adjectivally, though I have no such feeling for 'shit'. [I would not say 'it was so fun'.]

Of course the poster, Pepa's, was asking what is 'correct', which is an interesting question.

And as almost always, the answer depends on context and on what you mean by correct.

I would not recommend that any student use "fun" as an adjective in an exam context unless certain, perhaps through discussion in class, that this is going to be acceptable to whoever marks the test. As is clear from the comments here and in other threads on the topic, there are many who consider it incorrect.

But any student seeking to speak colloquial English, especially among young people, needs to know that this usage is considered entirely normal.

Very fun? Fun as an adjective.
make something more fun?

Thank you very much for all your answers. I see it´s a controversial issue.
You have to know that in Spanish "<Spanish word> (fun)" can only be an adjetive, that´s why it is so difficult for us to apply another treatment. We say "< a Spanish sentence >" which we tend automatically to translate "It was so fun to be together" instead of "such fun"....
I appreciate your explanations.

:) < a Spanish sentence > - there is a very similar English adjective - diverting - "It was so diverting (pleasantly amusing) to be together" but it is now rarely used.
