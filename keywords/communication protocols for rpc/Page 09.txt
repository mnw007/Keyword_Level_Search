Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
Definition - What does Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mean?
A remote procedure call (RPC) is a network programming model or interprocess communication technique that is used for point-to-point communications between software applications. Client and server applications communicate during this process.

A remote procedure call is sometimes called a function call or a subroutine call

Techopedia explains Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
The way RPC works is that a sender or client creates a request in the form of a procedure, function or method call to a remote server, which RPC translates and sends. When the remote server receives the request, it sends a response back to the client and the application continues its process.

When the server processes the call or request, the client waits for the server to finish processing before resuming its process. In general, RPC applications use software modules called proxies and stubs, which make them look like local procedure calls (LPC).
